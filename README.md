[Python Machine Learning Mini-Course](https://machinelearningmastery.com/python-machine-learning-mini-course/) 是 Jason Brownlee 在 Machine Learning Mastery 所發表的一篇教學文，內容淺顯易懂，對於想要透過 Python 來入手機器學習的新手來說，是很好的文章，在這裡分享給大家。

## 14 天從開發者到機器學習工作者

Python 已經成為應用機器學習領域中發展最快速的平台語言之一。

在這門簡短的課程中，你會了解到如何在 14 天內，使用 Python 來建構機器學習模型，並且有自信地完成一個機器學習的專案。

這是一篇很重要的文章，你可以把他加入書籤中。

讓我們開始吧！

[更新] Oct/2016: 更新範例至 sklearn v0.18
[更新] Feb/2018: 更新 Python 和 library 版本
[更新] March/2018: 更改某些資料集的下載連結，某些連結已經失效

## 這門課程的對象是誰？

在我們開始學習之前，讓我們確保你站在正確的位置。

底下我描述了一些通則，讓你知道這門課所設計的學習對象為何。

如果你不完全符合以下的條件，別緊張，你可能只要在某一個或幾個領域重新學習就可以跟上。

- 知道如何撰寫一些程式碼的開發者。這代表說你在學習一門新的語言，像是 Python 時，一旦你知道了基本的語法，這不是太大的問題。這不代表你需要是一個開發狂熱份子，只要你可以輕鬆的了解基本的 C 或類似於 C 語言的語法即可。
- 知道一點點機器學習相關知識的開發者。意味者你知道基本的 cross-validation、一些演算法和偏差和方差之間的取捨 (Bias–variance tradeoff) 等概念。

這門基本的課程並不是 Python 或機器學習的教科書。

這門課程會讓你從一個知道一點點機器學習的開發者，成長為一個能使用 Python 相關生態系來得到機器學習所訓練出來的模型結果。

Python Machine Learning Mini-Course
by Jason Brownlee on September 26, 2016 in Python Machine Learning
From Developer to Machine Learning Practitioner in 14 Days
Python is one of the fastest-growing platforms for applied machine learning.

In this mini-course, you will discover how you can get started, build accurate models and confidently complete predictive modeling machine learning projects using Python in 14 days.

This is a big and important post. You might want to bookmark it.

Let’s get started.

Update Oct/2016: Updated examples for sklearn v0.18.
Update Feb/2018: Update Python and library versions.
Update March/2018: Added alternate link to download some datasets as the originals appear to have been taken down.

Who Is This Mini-Course For?
Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place.

The list below provides some general guidelines as to who this course was designed for.

Don’t panic if you don’t match these points exactly, you might just need to brush up in one area or another to keep up.

Developers that know how to write a little code. This means that it is not a big deal for you to pick up a new programming language like Python once you know the basic syntax. It does not mean you’re a wizard coder, just that you can follow a basic C-like language with little effort.
Developers that know a little machine learning. This means you know the basics of machine learning like cross-validation, some algorithms and the bias-variance trade-off. It does not mean that you are a machine learning Ph.D., just that you know the landmarks or know where to look them up.
This mini-course is neither a textbook on Python or a textbook on machine learning.

It will take you from a developer that knows a little machine learning to a developer who can get results using the Python ecosystem, the rising platform for professional machine learning.

Mini-Course Overview
This mini-course is broken down into 14 lessons.

You could complete one lesson per day (recommended) or complete all of the lessons in one day (hard core!). It really depends on the time you have available and your level of enthusiasm.

Below are 14 lessons that will get you started and productive with machine learning in Python:

- Lesson 1: Download and Install Python and SciPy ecosystem.
- Lesson 2: Get Around In Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.
- Lesson 3: Load Data From CSV.
- Lesson 4: Understand Data with Descriptive Statistics.
- Lesson 5: Understand Data with Visualization.
- Lesson 6: Prepare For Modeling by Pre-Processing Data.
- Lesson 7: Algorithm Evaluation With Resampling Methods.
- Lesson 8: Algorithm Evaluation Metrics.
- Lesson 9: Spot-Check Algorithms.
- Lesson 10: Model Comparison and Selection.
- Lesson 11: Improve Accuracy with Algorithm Tuning.
- Lesson 12: Improve Accuracy with Ensemble Predictions.
- Lesson 13: Finalize And Save Your Model.
- Lesson 14: Hello World End-to-End Project.

Each lesson could take you 60 seconds or up to 30 minutes. Take your time and complete the lessons at your own pace. Ask questions and even post results in the comments below.

The lessons expect you to go off and find out how to do things. I will give you hints, but part of the point of each lesson is to force you to learn where to go to look for help on and about the Python platform (hint, I have all of the answers directly on this blog, use the search feature).

I do provide more help in the early lessons because I want you to build up some confidence and inertia.
